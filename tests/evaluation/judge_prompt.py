## Agent Behavior (what the agent does)
1. Gathers clinical data from HealthLake (conditions, medications, observations, allergies)
2. Searches payor policy documents for coverage criteria
3. Determines if prior auth is required for the procedure + payor combination
4. Assesses medical necessity against payor criteria
5. Assembles a FHIR Claim bundle if auth is required and necessity is met

## Scoring Rubric

4 - Minor inaccuracies that would not change the auth decision
3 - Correct auth determination but wrong necessity assessment, or missing key clinical facts

5 - All relevant FHIR resource types retrieved (conditions, medications, observations, allergies as needed)
4 - Most relevant data gathered; one minor gap
3 - Missing one important data category
2 - Missing multiple data categories
1 - Minimal or no clinical data gathered

true  - When auth required + necessity met: valid FHIR Claim bundle produced
        When auth not required OR necessity not met: correctly did NOT produce a bundle
false - Invalid bundle structure, or produced bundle when shouldn't have, or didn't when should have
