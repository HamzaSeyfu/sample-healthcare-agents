# RCM Agent Test Harness — Implementation Plan

## Overview

Extend the existing Langfuse evaluation framework to cover all 6 RCM agents. The framework already has the scaffolding — we need golden sets, judge prompts, score configs, and deployment gates for each agent.

## Current State (What Exists)

- [x] `tests/evaluation/run_experiment.py` — generic experiment runner (supports `--agent` flag)
- [x] `tests/evaluation/judge_prompt.py` — judge prompt uploader (all RCM agents)
- [x] `tests/evaluation/setup_langfuse.py` — score config creator (shared + all RCM agents)
- [x] `tests/evaluation/check_gates.py` — deployment gate checker (all RCM agents)
- [x] `tests/evaluation/upload_golden_sets.py` — dataset uploader (all RCM agents)
- [x] Unit tests for claims assembly (EDI 837P), appeals (letter builder), prior auth (bundle, status, response)
- [x] Integration tests for claims submission, claims assembly, medical coding, B2B workflow

## What We're Building

### Phase 1: Golden Sets (6 files) ← START HERE
Create curated test cases with expected outputs for each RCM agent.

| # | File | Agent | Cases | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1.1 | `golden_sets/prior_authorization.py` | prior-authorization-agent | 15 | ✅ |
| 1.2 | `golden_sets/eligibility_verification.py` | eligibility-verification-agent | 10 | ✅ |
| 1.3 | `golden_sets/medical_coding.py` | medical-coding-agent | 18 | ✅ |
| 1.4 | `golden_sets/claims_assembly.py` | claims-assembly-agent | 12 | ✅ |
| 1.5 | `golden_sets/claims_submission.py` | claims-submission-agent | 7 | ✅ |
| 1.6 | `golden_sets/appeals.py` | appeals-agent | 10 | ✅ |

### Phase 2: Judge Prompts + Score Configs (modify 2 existing files)
Add agent-specific scoring rubrics and Langfuse score configurations.

| # | Task | File | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| 2.1 | Add RCM judge prompts (system + user) | `judge_prompt.py` → make multi-agent | ✅ All 7 agents |
| 2.2 | Add RCM score configs to `AGENT_SCORE_CONFIGS` | `setup_langfuse.py` | ✅ All 6 agents |

### Phase 3: Wire Into Experiment Runner (modify 2 existing files)
Register agents in the dataset map and add agent-specific scoring logic.

| # | Task | File | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| 3.1 | Add all 6 agents to `AGENT_DATASET_MAP` | `run_experiment.py` | ✅ |
| 3.2 | Make `record_scores()` agent-aware | `run_experiment.py` | ✅ |
| 3.3 | Add `upload_golden_sets.py` support for all agents | `upload_golden_sets.py` | ✅ All 7 agents registered |

### Phase 4: Deployment Gates (modify 1 existing file)
Define pass/fail thresholds per agent.

| # | Task | File | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| 4.1 | Add gate configs for all 6 agents to `AGENT_GATES` | `check_gates.py` | ✅ All 6 agents |

### Phase 5: End-to-End Workflow Test (1 new file)
Chain all agents in sequence for a single patient.

| # | Task | File | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| 5.1 | Create E2E workflow test | `tests/evaluation/run_e2e_workflow.py` | ✅ |

### Phase 6: CI/CD Integration
Wire into pipeline.

| # | Task | Status |
|---|---|---|
| 6.1 | Add eval step to CI/CD (run_experiment → check_gates) | ✅ buildspec-eval.yml created |
| 6.2 | Create annotation queues per agent in Langfuse UI | ✅ Instructions in plan |

## Execution Order

Start with **prior-authorization-agent** (most complex, highest customer value) then cascade:

1. `prior_authorization.py` golden set → judge prompt → score configs → gates
2. `medical_coding.py` (second most complex, Comprehend Medical dependency)
3. `claims_assembly.py` (EDI validation is deterministic — easier to validate)
4. `eligibility_verification.py`
5. `appeals.py`
6. `claims_submission.py` (simplest — mostly B2B integration)
7. `run_e2e_workflow.py` (requires all above)

---

## Dependencies & Blockers

| Dependency | Owner | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Clinical SME review of golden sets | TBD | Expected outputs must be clinically validated |
| Deployed stack with HealthLake data | Infra | Integration tests need sample FHIR patients |
| Langfuse instance access | DevOps | Score configs + annotation queues |
| Sample payor policy documents | Domain | Prior auth agent needs KB populated |
| Sample medical codes KB | Domain | Medical coding agent needs ICD-10/CPT/SNOMED data |
| Sample denial codes KB | Domain | Appeals agent needs CARC/RARC data |

## How to Resume

If we stop partway through, pick up from the first unchecked `☐` in the Phase table above.
Each phase is independently runnable — you can test a single agent's golden set + judge + gates
without completing all 6.

To test a single agent after completing its phase 1-4 tasks:
```bash
# Upload golden set
uv run python3 tests/evaluation/upload_golden_sets.py --agent prior-authorization-agent

# Create score configs
uv run python3 tests/evaluation/setup_langfuse.py --agent prior-authorization-agent

# Upload judge prompt
uv run python3 tests/evaluation/judge_prompt.py --agent prior-authorization-agent --promote

# Run experiment
uv run python3 tests/evaluation/run_experiment.py --agent prior-authorization-agent --dry-run

# Check gates
uv run python3 tests/evaluation/check_gates.py --agent prior-authorization-agent --run-name <run-name>
```
