## Priority Gaps (highest value not yet built)

1. **Prior Authorization** — #1 admin burden for providers, well-defined multi-agent workflow
2. **Denial Management** — pairs with existing claims patterns, 60% of denials are recoverable
3. **Sepsis Early Warning** — high clinical impact, real-time streaming fits AgentCore well
4. **Care Gap Closure** — payer-side, FHIR integration already exists
